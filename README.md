📱💬 Text-Savvy - Become a better texter!

Hello, texter extraordinaire! Have you ever caught yourself in the middle of a conversation and wondered, "How am I doing with my texting game?" Fear not! Text-Savvy is here to be your cheeky little helper, your personal AI etiquette coach, and your friendly neighborhood text score provider.

💁‍♀️ What's Text-Savvy, you ask?
Text-Savvy is a fabulous, user-friendly React application that does one thing - it evaluates your text messages. But it doesn't stop there, no siree! It also offers you gasp feedback! Send your message into the void and get scored by an AI, who will spill the tea on your text game. Your scores are color-coded for that extra "pop". Red for "Could be better" (scores below 4), yellow for "Getting there" (scores 5-7), and green for "Textpert!" (scores 8-10).
